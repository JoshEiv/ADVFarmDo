Project Description

FarmDo addresses the need for proper recording and monitoring of farm activities. Many farm tasks are done daily, and without proper documentation, it can be easy to forget important details. FarmDo provides a digital logbook where users can:

- Record daily farm activities

- View previously logged activities

- Update or delete existing records

- Securely access their data through user authentication

The application uses Firebase Authentication for secure login and Firestore Database to store activity records in real time.
